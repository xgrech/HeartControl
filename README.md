# Music HeartControl

The aim of this project was to examine possible uses of heart rate for various interactions between the user and the device. The thesis analyses currently available uses of user heart rate and provides several new examples of its use. In this work, we describe the influence of music on the autonomic nervous system and we also look into other possibilities of stimulating the heart rate. The practical part includes the design and description of the implementation of the Android application, which evaluates the condition of the organism through heart rate data and stimulates the organism by choosing a suitable sound file. By implementing the application, we managed to prove that the heart rate can function in the decision-making process as a factor stimulating change and that the organism can be stimulated into optimal state through analysis of the heart rate.

## Enviroment
